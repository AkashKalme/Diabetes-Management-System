    <section id="disclaimer">
    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        Our Diabetes Prediction System is powered by advanced machine learning models and predictive algorithms. However, it's important to note the following:
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>1. Predictive Accuracy:</strong> While our models are designed to provide accurate predictions based on the available data, no prediction system is infallible. Predictions are probabilistic and subject to inherent uncertainties.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>2. Data Dependencies:</strong> The accuracy of predictions depends on the quality and completeness of the data you provide. Incomplete or inaccurate data may lead to less reliable predictions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>3. Not a Substitute for Medical Advice:</strong> Our Diabetes Prediction System is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It is meant to assist individuals and healthcare professionals in assessing diabetes risk and making informed decisions. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for personalized medical advice and treatment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>4. Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Diabetes risk can change over time due to various factors, including lifestyle changes and aging. It's important to use our system as part of an ongoing health monitoring plan.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>5. Privacy and Security:</strong> We prioritize the privacy and security of your data. However, no online platform is completely immune to data breaches. Please review our <a href="#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> for more information on how we handle your data.
